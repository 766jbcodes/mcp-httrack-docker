HTTTRACK-MCP SERVER OVERVIEW
===========================

1. Project Context and Goals
---------------------------
Modern whitelabel financial calculators require rapid, accurate branding for each client. When clients do not provide brand assets directly, we need a reliable, automated way to extract colours, fonts, logos, and layout details from their public websites. This ensures a consistent, high-quality user experience and streamlines onboarding.

2. Role of HTTrack in the Workflow
----------------------------------
HTTrack is used as a research tool to download a complete copy of a client's public website, including CSS, images, and fonts. This local copy provides the raw material for automated scripts to analyse and extract brand assets. HTTrack is not used as a theming engine, but as a source of truth for brand analysis.

3. Recommendation: htttrack-mcp Server
--------------------------------------
To standardise and automate the asset extraction process, we will build an "htttrack-mcp" server. This server will:
- Accept crawl requests via a REST API
- Run HTTrack to download the target website
- Analyse the downloaded assets to extract branding information (colours, fonts, logos, etc.)
- Return structured results for use in theming and UI generation

4. Technical Plan Summary
-------------------------
**API Design:**
- POST /crawl
  - Input: JSON with target URL and crawl options
  - Output: Job ID
- GET /result/{job_id}
  - Output: JSON with extracted brand assets (colours, fonts, logo paths, etc.)

**Architecture:**
- Node.js/TypeScript server (for cross-platform compatibility)
- Runs HTTrack CLI as a child process
- Post-processing scripts analyse the output directory for brand assets
- Results are stored and served via the API

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Set up Node.js/TypeScript project and REST API endpoints
2. Implement job queue and HTTrack CLI integration
3. Develop asset extraction scripts (colours, fonts, logos)
4. Store and serve results via API
5. Test end-to-end with real client sites

This approach provides a repeatable, scalable solution for automated brand asset extraction, supporting rapid onboarding and consistent quality across all client calculators.
